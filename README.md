They are there to get you further on your learning journey!

### There are two parts
1. the ones who ask questions
2. the others who answer with questions

### Rules for someone who asks a question
1. Search if anyone else asked the same question before you
2. If you cannot find a similar question -> ask your question in the Q&Q discussions

### Rules for someone who responds with a question
1. Do **NOT** respond with the solution directly
2. Reply with a question that guides towards the right answer
